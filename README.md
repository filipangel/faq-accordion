## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Plain Javascript

### What I learned

Similar to the [Interactive Rating Component](https://github.com/filipangel/interactive-rating-component) challenge. The CSS and JS were rather straight-forward so this challenge served mostly as a reminder of all the things I've learned about HTML, CSS and manipulating the DOM using plain Javascript.
